# 🚀 Performance Analysis Project

## 📋 Overview

This project focuses on AI-driven software performance optimization analysis. We use machine learning and large language models to identify performance bottlenecks and provide optimization recommendations for software systems.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- 🐍 **Python** - Core implementation
- 📊 **YourKit Profiler** - Performance data collection
- 🤖 **Machine Learning** - TensorFlow/PyTorch
- 🧠 **Large Language Models** - Optimization recommendations
- 🕸️ **Hypergraph Neural Networks** - Pattern analysis

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zhz20/performance.git
cd performance
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🔄 Performance Optimization Pipeline

1. 📊 Dynamic profiling data collection
2. 🔧 Feature extraction and preprocessing
3. 🤖 AI model inference for hotspot detection
4. 🧠 LLM-based solution generation
5. ✅ Validation and benchmarking

## 📈 Project Status

### ✅ Past Work
- Preliminary data collection testing on open-source projects:
  - 📄 **Apache PDFBox**
  - 🔧 **Apache Avro**  
  - 🌿 **Apache Ivy**
- Initial performance profiling and analysis pipeline setup

### 🔄 Ongoing Work
- Development of automated scripts to collect dynamic and static performance metrics from open-source projects
- Data collection framework for various Java applications
- 📁 Example data file included: `Method-list-CPU-commons-text-1.13.0.csv` (see repository)

### 🔮 Future Work (Next Few Months)
- 🎯 Fine-tuning Large Language Models for performance optimization recommendations
- 🔌 VS Code extension development for real-time hotspot detection
- ⚙️ Integration of AI models with development workflows

## 💻 Usage

```bash
# Run invocation analysis
python invocation.py

# Execute performance model
python model.py

# Run performance analysis script
./performance.sh
```

## 📊 Data Collection

We collect performance metrics using YourKit Profiler integration:

- ⏱️ **Method-level execution time**
- 💾 **Memory allocation patterns**
- 🖥️ **CPU utilization data**
- 📋 **Static code analysis metrics**

📄 Example data format available in the repository as `Method-list-CPU-commons-text-1.13.0.csv`.

## 🔬 Research

This work is part of ongoing research into AI-powered performance optimization, with preliminary findings published in our paper on hypergraph neural networks for performance analysis.
